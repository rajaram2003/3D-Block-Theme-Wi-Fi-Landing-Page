# 3D-Block-Theme-Wi-Fi-Landing-Page

## Overview

This project is a visually engaging landing page designed for a public Wi-Fi network service. It combines modern web design elements, such as 3D block effects and interactive animations, to create an immersive user experience. 

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
  
- **3D Block Image Gallery**: A grid of images is displayed in a 3D block format, giving depth and interactivity. Hovering over the images triggers rotations and scaling effects.
  
- **Header and Footer Animations**: Subtle animations in the header and footer enhance the visual flow, with the header sliding down from the top and the footer sliding up from the bottom.
  
- **Interactive Login Button**: The login button features a hover effect that scales and changes color, encouraging interaction and guiding users towards logging in to the Wi-Fi network.
  
- **Floating Image Entrance Animations**: The first two images in the 3D block gallery animate as the page loads, sliding into view from opposite directions, scaling, and rotating into place.
  
- **Stylized Navigation and Social Links**: Navigation and social media links are styled to match the theme, with smooth hover effects and transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and ensuring semantic clarity.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including animations, 3D transforms, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: Can be used to enhance animations or add additional interactive features.
